## Can I run it in HiveOS ?

Soon, we hope. It will be included.

## It says the pool is not supported ?

Ask us to add it. We will configure the miner. 

## Is it a computer virus ?

No. No way. But viruses are known to exploit coin mining for profit.

## How to mine Vertcoin ?

Currently we do not have Vertcoin algorithm support for Team Black Miner.

We have to merge the code from SPMiner and it will be included in version 2.0.

So if you want to mine Vertcoin + Zil you must dualmine with SPMiner and Team Black Miner.
