# Frequently asked questions

(Sorted by most frequently asked)

## Can I run it in HiveOS ?

Soon, we hope. It will be included.

## What is the best pools for this miner ?

Since, TBM can produce 1-2 % stales with high intensity (--xintensity) pools that reward stale shares is the best for this miner.

Also a high difficulty pool port is recomended with a high intensity setting.

Note that the ethereum blockchain rewards stale work/blocks. They are called uncle blocks. The uncle blocks are protecting the security of the blockchain.

Good pools for TBMiner:
+ Miningpoolhub (100% reward for stale shares)
+ 2miners (100% reward for stale shares)
+ nanopool (100% reward for stale shares)
+ woolypooly (100% reward for stale shares)
+ ezil (70% reward for stale shares)
+ hiveon (80% reward for stale shares)

## What is the best --xinstensity settings.

You can try for yourself or ask others.
Different GPU cards might have different best settings,
both with OC and the intensity setting. And the pool is important.

## It says the pool is not supported ?

Ask us to add it. We will configure the miner. 

## The miner produce stales ?

Yes it might. You can lower the intensity setting (--xintensity) to reduce stale shares.

With the right settings you could have none.

But you can also see it as an extra bonus to accepted shares if you use a pool that pays for stale shares.

## Is it a computer virus ?

No. No way. But viruses are known to exploit coin mining for profit.
